# rrduino

The goal of this project is to make the Arduino a versitile little time-based data collection device. The data that the Arduino collects is to be sent of to a server over Ethernet where the data will be added to an RRD database.

## The Protocol

The protocol is simple. Each command is one line long (ending in a newline \n), each argument separated by a single space. There are two commands so far: the hello and the update.

### Hello

`h client_id`

The response from the server is a 32-byte blob of key material. The session key is generated from this blob by using SHA256-HMAC with the master pre-shared key.

### Update

`u key1 value1 [key2 value2 key3 value 3 ..] hmac`

This message has no response. There should be at least one key-value pair, separated by spaces. The final argument, `hmac`, is the lower-case ASCII representation of the result of hashing the preceeding data using HMAC-SHA256 with the session key, i.e. `HMAC-SHA256(session_key, "u key1 value1 [key2 value2 key3 value 3 ..]")`

For example, `temperature` could be a key and `30.1` could be its value. The resulting message might look like `u temperature 30.1 a103c31cbffe0102a103c31cbffe0102a103c31cbffe0102a103c31cbffe0102`. The server can then decide how to format the `rrdupdate` command based on these key-value pairs.

## Authentication

The server and client protocol support signing of messages. The server and the client have a pre-shared key. The server knows which key to use by the `client_id` specified in the hello message. A separate session key is generated from this pre-shared key and some random key material that is shared during the "hello" exchange.  If the server and client have the same pre-shared key, the session key should be able to be generated by both the client and the server but not a third party.

Each message can be signed using HMAC-SHA256. To do this on the Arduino requires a third-party library: https://github.com/jkiv/Cryptosuite
